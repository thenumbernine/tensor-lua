My first take at a tensor calculator in lua.

Strictly numeric.

Made to eventually work with my symbolic lua utility at http://github.com/thenumbernine/symmath-lua
...but i made this one first, so all it is good for is shorthand numeric tensor calculations.

Demo at http://christopheremoore.net/tensor-calculator.

The nested array functionality got migrated into my lua matrix library.  Maybe the rest of it will get there eventually.
